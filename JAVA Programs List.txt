18]WAJP to identify the factorial of a given number.
19]WAJP to check whether the given number is a perfect number or not.
(Note: A Perfect number means the sum of a factor of numbers, except the given number should be equal to the given number)
20] WAJP to check given number is a strong number or weak number. (Note: The summation of each digit factorial will be equal to the given no. Then we call it as Strong no.)
21] WAJP to check whether the given number is prime no. or not. (Note: The no. which is divisible by 1 & itself is known as Prime No.) 
22] WAJP to print the prime no from the given range.
23] WAJP to check whether the given no is a perfect square or not.
24] WAJP to check whether the given no. is neon or not.(the no. which is given make a square of it & identify the sum of digits of square no. & check the sum of digits equals the givenno.)
25]WAJP to check whether the given no. is sunny. or not. (Take anyone no. add 1 to it,& check if it is a perfect square or not if yes then it's sunny no. else not) 
26] WAJP to check whether given no. is xylem or Phloem. ( The sum of 1st digit and last digit will be equal to the sum of the middle digits then it is xylem else phloem)
27]WAJP to check given no. is happy no. or sad no. (if the sum of each digit square is equal to one then it's a happy number, if the sum of each digit square equals 4 then it's sad no.)


*Array Programs*

* Array is a predefined class present in Java.lang package.
* It's considered as a non-primitive datatype in Java.
* An array is a continuous block of memory that is used to store multiple values or data.
* It's a collection of homogenous elements.
* array is fixed size in nature.
* Whenever we create an array object mentioning/assigning datatype and passing size is mandatory.
* By default in an array object the default value of the datatype is stored.
* To store and access an element from an array, we need an array reference variable and an index
* (Array Ref. Var- a variable which stores the address of an array object is known as 'Array Ref.Var)
* (Index - It's a +ve integer no. which starts with zero.)
[Note: to store multiple values, we need to create an array object. We can create an array object in two ways: 1] using the new keyword and  2] without using the new keyword.]

*String Programs*

*It's a predefined final class present in java.lang package.
*It's a group of characters which is enclosed within " ".
*Anything which is written in " " is a string.
*String is predefined non-primitive datatype
